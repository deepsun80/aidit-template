This includes audits of procedures and work instructions as well.\\n Internal audits are scheduled and conducted based on previous audit results and the status\\n and importance of the activity. Personnel independent of those audits having direct\\n responsibility for the audited activity conduct them.\\n Audit results including required improvements become a matter of record and then forwarded\\n to the management personnel having responsibility for the area audited.\\n Specific management personnel responsible for the area under audit will take the necessary\\n corrective action without undue delay to eliminate the nonconformities and report the\\n verification results.\\n Follow-up audit activities are performed to verify the results and effectiveness of the corrective\\n action taken.\\n The internal audit process results are reviewed at least four times every twelve (12) months\\n during management review.
