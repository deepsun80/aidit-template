C&G labs will immediately notify I of any regulatory action taken against C&G labs that would affect product availability or bring into question the quality and safety of the Products sourced by I. \n\n\n\nI shall notify C&G labs within twenty-four (24) hours of any FDA, ISO or any other regulatory agency audit of I that is related to Products cleaned at C&G labs site or services provided by C&G labs and notify C&G labs of any applicable findings or corrective actions related to the Products.  In addition, where a response or corrective action and preventive action are required, I will submit a response to C&G labs for review prior to submission, as applicable.\n\n\n\nRecord Retention\n\nC&G labs shall retain all documentation generated during the manufacturing process as required by I’s Standard Operating Procedures (hereinafter “SOPs”) and based on the expected life of the device, but no less than five (5) years from the date of release of the device for commercial distribution. I shall retain distribution documentation in accordance with I’s SOPs.\n\nAgreement Maintenance\n\nThis Quality Agreement may be reviewed as mutually agreed upon by the Parties.
